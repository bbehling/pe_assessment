# EhangerMarketplaceClient

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.20.

## Steps to install and run

1. CD into this project's directory
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Improvements

- Format the data as Geojson
  - I would have the server format a Geojson response
- I reused an existing Leaflet Components app to save time
  - This manually bootstrapped the app
  - Start from scratch using a non-manually bootstrapped app
